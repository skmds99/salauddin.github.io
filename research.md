This page outlines some of the problems I'm currently working on related to **functional identities in rings and algebras**. If you have suggestions or related references, feel free to reach out—I'm always open to discussion!

## Characterization of Functional Identities
I'm studying expressions of the form  
\\[
f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \sum_i a_i x_{j_1}^{k_1} x_{j_2}^{k_2} \cdots x_{j_m}^{k_m}
\\]  
that vanish identically on certain rings or algebras, or satisfy specific constraints (e.g., centrality, symmetry). A major goal is to classify all such identities under mild assumptions on the ring.

### Questions:
- Under what structural conditions on a ring \\( R \\) do all functional identities reduce to standard polynomial identities?
- What are the consequences of a functional identity holding on a dense subset of \\( R \\)?

## Functional Identities in Prime and Semiprime Rings
Inspired by work from Brešar and others, I’m exploring how identities behave differently in prime versus semiprime rings. For example, if a functional identity holds in a semiprime ring, can it always be extended to a larger algebra or a ring of quotients?

### Currently:
- Reading and taking notes on Brešar's work on functional identities.
- Attempting to generalize certain known results to algebras with involution or to PI rings.

## Connection to Polynomial and Generalized Derivations
Many functional identities arise from derivations or generalized derivations. I'm investigating how such maps can induce functional identities and whether these identities impose constraints on the structure of the ring.

### Problems of interest:
- Given a functional identity induced by a derivation, when does the derivation have to be inner?
- What identities arise naturally in algebras with a nontrivial center?

## Future Goals
- Extend known results to settings in algebraic geometry, particularly for coordinate rings of varieties.
- Explore computational approaches to identify or verify functional identities.
