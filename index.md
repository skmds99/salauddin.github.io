# Welcome!

My name is **Sk Md Salauddin**, and I’m currently a PhD student at **Aligarh Muslim University (AMU)**.

My research focuses on **functional identities in rings and algebras**, a subject that I find both rich and fascinating. I’m currently reading **Matej Brešar’s** book on this topic to explore it in greater depth.

Alongside research, I’m also interested in **Mathematics**, **Music**, **Poetry**, and **Coding**, and I continue to stay active in all of these areas.

You can learn more about my academic and professional journey in the **Work** tab, and see what I’ve been reading lately in the **Books** tab.

I'm also exploring some open problems in mathematics — head over to the **Problems** tab to check them out, and feel free to get in touch if you’d like to discuss!
